What did I build it with

- Angular 5
- NodeJs Lambdas
- TDD'ed the pricing mechanism
- Deployment scripts to S3.
- Google Drive intergration as Databases
- Email service for invoicing

Actually this was the 2nd iteration of this project. Initially it was deployed on AWS ....
However, to drive cost saving as the service does not have a lot of traffic, I decided to change the deployment paridgim to S3 and Lambdas.
