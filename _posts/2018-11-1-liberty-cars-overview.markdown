What did I build it with

- Angular 5
- NodeJs Lambdas
- Deployment scripts to S3.
- Google Drive integration as Databases
- AWS SES Email service for invoicing
- API's auth'ed with JSON web tokens

This was the 2nd iteration of this project. Initially, it was deployed on AWS Lightsail, however, to drive cost saving as the service does not have a lot of traffic, I decided to change the deployment paradigm to S3, Lambdas, and Google Drive.
