## Hello everyone out there! 👋  ✌️ ️
This is something I have been thinking for a while but never got the time to do it.

While attending [Velocity](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity), I was inspired by the cool tech and possiblities out there.
I therefore decided creating a summary and overview for people to get a brief introduction on topics touched upon at the Conference, would be something I would enjoy doing.

Well here it is!! 🎉

I am going to try do a bit of this, on technology, projects I have worked on, concepts I find awesome that we use at work (event sourcing, Kubernetes etc), possibly some triathlon and maybe some travelling blog posts!

We shall see what the future brings.

Its an idea, hopefully, it does not die out too soon 🤞🏻
