<p>Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am Lefteris!
As an undergraduate, I launched my own e-commerce company - CreteCompare - a car rental comparison website for the island of Crete. Whilst this project was short-lived, it provided me with a strong foundation in designing and implementing business applications, and it has been an invaluable lesson for acquiring technical and business acumen. 
</p>

<p>
<!-- For three years, I worked in the e-commerce team of Elsevier as a Software Engineer. -->
My most recent career move was in September 2019 to <a href="https://www.vocovo.com/">VoCoVo</a>, as a Senior Software Engineer. As of August 2020 I have become the DevOps Tech Lead, where I managed the workload of two engineers. I am passionate about improving the development experience, reducing barriers of releasing and solving bottlenecks within systems. 
Some notable achievements of the last year are:  
</p>
<ul class="skill-list">
<li> the migration from Digital Ocean to Azure.</li>
<li> the introduction of DataDog for monitoring.</li>
<li> automation of tests in Jenkins.</li>
<li> change of the release process from biweekly to continuous. </li>
<li> improvement of build times by 150%.</li>
</ul>
