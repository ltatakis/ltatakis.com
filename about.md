<p>Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am Lefteris!
As an undergraduate, I launched my own e-commerce company - CreteCompare - a car rental comparison website for the island of Crete. Whilst this project was short-lived, it provided me with a strong foundation in designing and implementing business applications, and it has been an invaluable lesson for acquiring technical and business acumen.

<!-- For three years, I worked in the e-commerce team of Elsevier as a Software Engineer. -->
In September 2019 I joined <a href="https://www.vocovo.com/">VoCoVo</a> as a Senior Software Engineer. As of August 2020 I have become the DevOps Tech Lead, where I managed the workload of two engineers. I am passionate about improving the development experience, reducing barriers of releasing and solving bottlenecks within systems. 

I am currently working for <a href="https://www.thebodycoach.com/">The Bodycoach</a> as a Platform engineer.

Outside work, I am a keen triathlete having completed my first Ironman in Portugal in 2022. I am a qualified British Triathlon coach, coaching at OxfordTri.
