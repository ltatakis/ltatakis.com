<p>Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I am Lefteris! A software engineer committed to solving problems and always up for a challenge.
</p>
<p>
I am a highly motivated and entrepreneurial individual, who is eager to learn and interested in problem-solving, ready to take on any challenge.
</p>
<p>
As an undergraduate, I launched my own e-commerce company - CreteCompare - a car rental comparison website for the island of Crete, in which I collaborated with a number of local companies.
Whilst this project was short-lived, it provided me with a strong foundation in designing and implementing business applications, and it has been an invaluable lesson for acquiring technical and business acumen. 
</p>

<p>
For three years, I worked in in the e-commerce team of Elsevier as a Software Engineer.
In September 2019, I made the move to <a href="https://www.vocovo.com/">VoCoVo</a>, as a Senior Software Engineer. As of August 2020 I have become the DevOps Tech Lead, were my first project was moving all the infrastructure from Digital Ocean to Azure with a team of two other engineers.
